# TimeNETOptimizationEnvironment
Batch simulation of SCPN with TimeNET and parameter based optimization


## Features
* Batch simulation of SCPN with TimeNET 4.2 for design space exploration
* Simulation based Optimization using several heuristics
  * Hill Climbing
  * Simulated Annealing
  * Artifical Bee Colony
  * Charged System Search
  * Mean-Variance Optimization
* Testing optimization on cached simulation data
* Benchmark functions to use instead of live simulation
  * Matya
  * Schefel
  * Sphere
  * Ackley
* Result plotting with R

## System Requirements
* Operating Systems: Windows, Linux, OSX (maybe others)
* Java 1.7 or newer
* TimeNET 4.2 or newer (https://www2.tu-ilmenau.de/downloadtimenet)
* R (http://www.r-project.org/) with some libs, mentioned in about-dialog
